# BERT Sentiment Analysis on Yelp Reviews

BERT sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique that uses BERT, a pre-trained deep learning model, to analyze and classify the sentiment or emotional tone expressed in text data. The process usually aims to determine whether a given piece of text conveys a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

Sentiment analysis can be highly beneficial for businesses for several reasons:

`Understanding Customer Feedback`
> Sentiment analysis helps businesses gain insights into how customers feel about their products, services, or brand. Analyzing customer reviews, social media comments, and other text data allows companies to understand the sentiment behind the feedback.

`Product Improvement`
> Sentiment analysis provides valuable feedback on what customers like or dislike about products or services. This information can be used to make product improvements, add new features, or refine existing ones.

`Brand Reputation Management`
> Monitoring sentiment allows businesses to proactively manage their online reputation. By addressing negative sentiment and promoting positive feedback, a business can influence its online image.

`Market Research`
> Sentiment analysis is a valuable tool for market research. It can reveal emerging trends, consumer preferences, and shifting market dynamics, helping businesses make informed decisions.

`Customer Segmentation`
> Sentiment analysis can be used to segment customers based on their sentiment. This can help businesses tailor marketing and communication strategies to different customer groups.

`Product Launches`
> Sentiment analysis can provide feedback on new product launches. By monitoring initial reactions, companies can adjust their marketing and product strategies accordingly.




#### How it works:

1.   BERT Pre-trained Model

The BERT model has been pre-trained on a large corpus of text data. During this pre-training, BERT learns to understand the context and relationships between words and phrases in a bidirectional manner, capturing rich semantic information.

2.   Fine-Tuning

To perform sentiment analysis, the pre-trained BERT model will be fine-tuned on a labelled sentiment analysis dataset. This fine-tuning involves training the model on a specific task, such as classifying text into sentiment categories.

3. Text Encoding

When providing a piece of text to the BERT sentiment analysis model, it encodes the text into numerical representations that it can understand. BERT uses WordPiece tokenization, which splits text into subword tokens, enabling it to handle a wide range of words and languages.

4. Sentiment Classification

The encoded text is then fed into the fine-tuned BERT model, which outputs a probability distribution over the possible sentiment categories. Common sentiment categories include positive, negative, neutral, and sometimes more fine-grained categories. The model assigns a sentiment label to the text based on the highest probability.

*In this project I will first initialise the pre-trained model, then scrape and gather review data from Yelp using Beautifulsoup. Finally, after the text data has been encoded, I will feed it into the fine-tuned BERT Model for sentiment analysis.*
